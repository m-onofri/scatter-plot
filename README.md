# Scatter Plot

In this project I create a scatter plot to display the 35 Fastest times up Alpe d'Huez in cycling races, comparing the performances of riders with doping allegations vs riders without doping allegation.
This is a project from the freeCodeCamp course and I made it using the D3.js library.

## How to clone the app locally...

Clone the git repository in the folder of your choice:
```
git clone https://github.com/m-onofri/scatter-plot.git
```

Go inside the **scatter-plot** folder and open the **index.html** file in your favorite browser.


## ...or watch it live!

You can have a look at this app [here](https://m-onofri.github.io/scatter-plot/).


## Main features

* In this project I used D3.js version 5.
* The x-axis is a time scale representing the year from 1993 to 2016.
* The y-axis is a time scale express in minutes.
* You can mouse hover each data point and see a tooltip which displays more information about this data (cyclist name, the year of the perfomance, the time of the performance and if the cyclist has a doping allegation).


## Cross-browser consistency 

The project was checked on MacOS in Chrome, Firefox, Opera and Safari, and on these browsers it works properly.







This is a project from freeCodeCamp. The goal of this project is to represent the 35 Fastest times up Alpe d'Huez in cycling races with a scatter plot. This graph compares the performances of riders with doping allegations vs riders without doping allegation. To represent these data I used the D3.js library (Data-Driven Document).
